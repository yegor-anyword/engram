# Engram

**A brain-inspired, portable context database for AI agents.**

Engram stores agent context as atomic knowledge **bullets** in a concept graph — not raw text. Any AI agent can connect to it regardless of which LLM or framework it uses. Context persists across sessions, transfers between models, and gets smarter with every use through reinforcement learning on context quality.

Inspired by how the human brain stores and retrieves memory — associative recall, schema formation, reconsolidation, active forgetting, and consolidation — and by three lines of recent agent-memory research: [Agentic Context Engineering (ACE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618), [Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07952), and [Mem-α](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25911). Every other agent memory product is building a filing cabinet. Engram is building something that learns.

## Why bother and why Engram?

Current AI agent frameworks store context as raw text, summaries, or vector chunks. This leads to:

- **Context decay** — details lost through repeated summarization
- **Context isolation** — Claude can't share context with GPT or Gemini
- **Context-as-text** — no structure, no relationships, no intent tracking
- **No learning** — context doesn't improve based on what actually worked

Engram solves these with:

- **Agnostic and portable** — We support all LLM: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek; all Agentic Frameworks: Langgraph, CrewAI, AG2; and all cloud platforms: AWS, GCP, Azure...
- **Atomic bullets** — discrete, individually-addressable knowledge units with usage tracking
- **Delta operations** — every mutation (including reconsolidation, core-memory edits) is an atomic delta op, never a wholesale rewrite, preventing context collapse and giving full audit + rollback
- **Cross-platform** — store once, materialize for any LLM (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models)
- **Reinforcement loop** — bullets that prove useful get stronger; unhelpful ones fade away
- **Core memory slot** — Mem-α-inspired always-in-context running summary (≤512 tokens) per context, rewritten by the Reflector and prepended at every recall so the agent never loses the high-level frame
- **Worked-example retrieval** — Dynamic-Cheatsheet-inspired: when a recall query is highly similar to a prior raw input, attach that prior input + the bullets it produced as a worked example next to the question
- **MMR diversity at recall** — Maximal Marginal Relevance ranking stops the token budget from filling with near-duplicate bullets
- **Optional validity gate** — Mem-α-inspired LM-judge filter at write time, dropping malformed / trivial candidates before they hit the graph
- **Multi-agent safe** — per-context advisory locks serialize delta application across concurrent agents
- **Bounded storage** — three-tier lifecycle (active → archived → purged) with capacity management
- **Canonical extraction** — server-level Reflector model ensures consistent bullets regardless of which agent committed
- **Future-proofing with raw input preservation** — every commit stores the original text (like git commits), enabling re-extraction with better models

## How It Works

Engram is a **server** that sits between your AI agents and a knowledge graph. Your agents talk to Engram over HTTP — they send raw text in and get structured context back out. The server does all the heavy lifting.

### The Core Loop

There are only two operations that matter: **commit** (write) and **materialize** (read).

![The Core Loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/softmaxdata/engram/main/diagrams/core-loop.png)

### What's a Bullet?

Instead of storing your agent's output as a blob of text, Engram breaks it into **bullets** — atomic, individually-trackable knowledge units. Each bullet has a type (`fact`, `decision`, `strategy`, `warning`, `procedure`, `exception`, `principle`, `episodic`), a salience score, and usage stats that track how often it's been recalled and whether it helped. `episodic` bullets (Mem-α inspired) are timestamped events — formatted `At {timestamp}, {actor} {did X}` — and are merged with a looser similarity threshold because multiple agents often paraphrase the same event.

![What's a Bullet?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/softmaxdata/engram/main/diagrams/bullet-anatomy.png)

### What's Reconsolidation?

This is Engram's learning mechanism, borrowed from neuroscience. When you recall memories and then use them, Engram tracks the outcome:

### What's the Reflector?

Your agents send raw text. They don't extract bullets themselves. The Engram **server** runs a canonical LLM (the "Reflector," configured in `.env`) that processes ALL raw input from ALL agents.

### What's a Context?

A **context** is a container for related knowledge — like a project or workspace. Each context has:

- An **intent anchor** (immutable objective that prevents drift)
- A **core memory** (Mem-α-inspired always-in-context summary, ≤512 tokens, edited by the Reflector and prepended at every recall)
- A **concept graph** (bullets + edges + schemas)
- **Capacity limits** (bounded storage with automatic lifecycle management)
- Its own **activity ledger** (permanent record of every raw input, with embeddings used to retrieve nearest-prior-input worked examples at recall time)

You can have as many contexts as you need. Agents specify which context to read from and write to.

### What gets returned at recall time?

A materialization call assembles, in this order:

1. **Core memory** — the always-in-context summary
2. **Intent anchor** — objective, success criteria, constraints
3. **Schemas** — abstract patterns (token-efficient compressions of repeated bullets)
4. **Bullets** — ranked by relevance × effective_salience × recency, then re-ordered with **MMR** (Maximal Marginal Relevance) so duplicates don't crowd the token budget
5. **Worked examples** — if the query is highly similar to a prior raw input, the prior input + bullets it produced are attached *last* (closest to the question), with a "verify before copying" caveat — borrowed from Dynamic Cheatsheet

The whole pack is rendered for the target model (Claude XML, GPT Markdown, etc.) and a `materialization_id` receipt is returned so the next commit can close the reconsolidation loop.

## Quick Start

### 0. Setting up storage

There are two storage options:
- SQLite (local) — zero setup, tables auto-created on first run
- PostgreSQL (local/remote) — requires creating the database first

For PostgreSQL, create the database and enable pgvector before starting the server:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE engram;
\c engram
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

Then set the environment variables:
```bash
ENGRAM_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres
ENGRAM_POSTGRES_DSN=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/engram
```

All tables are auto-created on first server start for both backends.

### 1. Configure the Server

Engram needs LLM API keys to extract knowledge from raw text. The server handles all LLM calls — agents never need to provide keys.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env

# ─── Database ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# SQLite for local development (zero setup)
ENGRAM_STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite
ENGRAM_SQLITE_PATH=./engram.db

# PostgreSQL for production (uncomment to use instead of SQLite)
# ENGRAM_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres
# ENGRAM_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://engram:password@localhost:5432/engram

# ─── Server ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
ENGRAM_HOST=0.0.0.0
ENGRAM_PORT=5820

# ─── LLM API Keys (required) ───────────────────────────────
# These are used SERVER-SIDE by the Reflector and Curator.
# Agents never see or need these keys.
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...           # For Reflector (concept extraction)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                  # For embeddings (similarity search)

# ─── Canonical Reflector ────────────────────────────────────
# The Reflector model processes ALL raw input from ALL agents.
# Using one model guarantees consistent bullet quality regardless
# of which agent (Claude, GPT, Gemini) committed the data.
ENGRAM_REFLECTOR_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5
ENGRAM_REFLECTOR_PROMPT_VERSION=v1
ENGRAM_MAX_REFLECTION_ROUNDS=2         # Self-refinement iterations

# ─── Curator ────────────────────────────────────────────────
ENGRAM_CURATOR_DEDUP_THRESHOLD=0.92    # Cosine similarity threshold for merging
ENGRAM_CURATOR_SLOW_PATH_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5  # For complex conflicts

# ─── Embedding ──────────────────────────────────────────────
ENGRAM_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small

# ─── Consolidation ──────────────────────────────────────────
ENGRAM_CONSOLIDATION_TRIGGER=every_10_commits  # or "daily", "manual"
ENGRAM_FAST_DECAY_RATE=0.97            # Per-day salience decay for normal bullets
ENGRAM_SLOW_DECAY_RATE=0.995           # Per-day decay for decisions/schemas (slower)

# ─── Auth (disabled for local dev, enable for production) ───
ENGRAM_AUTH_ENABLED=false
# COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-west-2_xxx
# COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID=xxx
```

### 2. Start the Server

**Local (SQLite):**

```bash
pip install engram-contextdb
engram
# Server running at http://localhost:5820
# Using .env for configuration
```

**Docker (PostgreSQL + pgvector):**

```bash
docker compose up
# Starts: Engram API + PostgreSQL + pgvector
# Reads .env for all configuration
```

### 3. Use the Python SDK

```python
import asyncio
from engram.sdk.client import Engram

async def main():
    # ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # Connect to the Engram server.
    # The SDK only needs the server URL — no LLM keys needed.
    # All concept extraction happens server-side using the
    # canonical Reflector model configured in .env.
    # ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    async with Engram(url="http://localhost:5820") as engram:

## LangGraph Integration Example

A complete example showing Engram as the memory backend for a LangGraph agent. The agent recalls context before responding and commits results after — creating a persistent memory that survives across sessions and improves over time.

```python
import asyncio
import operator
from typing import Annotated, TypedDict

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
from engram.sdk.client import Engram


# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# SETUP
#
# The LLM is what the agent uses to respond to the user.
# The Engram client connects to the Engram server for memory.
# These are separate — the agent's LLM does NOT process memory.
# The server's canonical Reflector (configured in .env) does that.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONTEXT_ID = None  # Will be created on first run, reused after

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")  # Agent's LLM
engram = Engram(url="http://localhost:5820")            # Memory server


# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# STATE
#
# LangGraph passes this state dict between nodes. Each node
# receives the full state and returns a partial dict of updates.
#
# Annotated[list, operator.add] means returned messages are
# APPENDED to the list, not replaced. So after setup → recall →
# respond, the messages list contains:
#   [HumanMessage, SystemMessage(memories), AIMessage(response)]
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]   # Chat messages — appended by each node
    context_id: str                           # Which Engram context to use
    materialization_id: str | None            # Receipt from last recall (for reconsolidation)


# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#   3. Canonical Reflector extracts insights into bullets
#   4. Curator decides delta operations (add/update/merge)
#   5. Deltas applied under per-context advisory lock
#   6. If materialization_id provided → reconsolidation fires:
#      - Looks up which bullets were in that recall
#      - Outcome="success" → hit_count++, salience boosted
#      - Outcome="failure" → miss_count++, salience decayed
#   7. Events emitted to any subscribed agents
#
# This example commits just the last human + AI exchange,
# because it commits after EVERY turn. If you committed the
# full message history every time, earlier messages would be
# reprocessed (the hash dedup catches exact duplicates, but
# slightly different formatting would bypass it).

### System Overview

![System Architecture](diagrams/architecture.png)

### Key Concepts

- **Bullet** — Atomic unit of knowledge (fact, decision, strategy, warning, principle, exception, procedure, episodic) with usage tracking. Bullets that prove useful get stronger over time.
- **Core Memory** — Mem-α-inspired ≤512-token blob per context, always loaded at recall time. The Reflector decides whether to rewrite it on each commit. Edits are themselves delta ops (`UPDATE_CORE_MEMORY`), so they're auditable and rollback-able.
- **Worked-Example Retrieval** — Dynamic-Cheatsheet-inspired. At recall time, the activity ledger is searched for the nearest prior raw input by cosine similarity (default ≥ 0.85). Hits are attached as last-position worked examples in the rendered prompt so the consuming LLM sees a precedent next to the question.
- **MMR Diversity Ranking** — Maximal Marginal Relevance (`λ * relevance − (1 − λ) * max_sim_to_picked`) replaces the greedy-by-score pack so the token budget doesn't fill with near-duplicates. λ is tunable per call.
- **Validity Gate** *(opt-in)* — Mem-α-inspired batched LM-judge run by the Curator before committing `ADD_BULLET` ops. Rejects empty / trivial / malformed candidates. One extra LLM call per commit; off by default.
- **Usage Stats in Render** *(opt-in)* — Dynamic-Cheatsheet-inspired. Each bullet's `(used N×, success Y/Z)` is surfaced in the rendered prompt so the consuming LLM can weight proven items.
- **SchemaNode** — Abstract pattern derived from repeated experiences. Enables efficient context encoding — only deltas from the expected pattern need storage.
- **DeltaOperation** — Every mutation is an atomic delta op in a DeltaBatch — including bullet add/update/remove/merge, core-memory rewrites, schema changes, and reconsolidation. Context is never regenerated wholesale, preventing context collapse and giving full audit + rollback.
- **IntentAnchor** — Immutable project objective that prevents context drift across sessions.
- **Effective Salience** — `salience × (0.5 + hit_rate)` once a bullet has been recalled enough times — bullets are ranked by proven usefulness, not just raw importance.
- **Reconsolidation** — When recalled context leads to success/failure, bullet usage stats update automatically via a `RECONSOLIDATE_BULLET` delta batch. Context gets smarter with every use.
- **Consolidation** — Background "sleep cycle" that decays unused knowledge, deduplicates, induces schemas, and archives stale bullets.
- **Canonical Reflector** — Server-level model config ensures ALL agents' raw input is processed by the SAME Reflector model. No cross-model extraction variance.
- **Raw Input Preservation** — Every commit stores the original text in the activity ledger (like git commits), along with its embedding (used by worked-example retrieval). Bullets can be regenerated from source.
- **Re-Extraction** — Recompile bullets from raw history with a new/better Reflector model. Like upgrading a compiler and recompiling from source.

### Concurrency Model

Multiple agents can compute in parallel — the lock only serializes delta application:

1. **Parallel phase** — Reflector + Curator run concurrently across agents
2. **Serialize phase** — `ContextLockManager` ensures only one `apply_batch()` runs at a time per context
3. **Revalidation** — Inside the lock, delta operations are checked for stale targets
4. **Event emission** — After commit, an event is pushed to all subscribers

### Data Lifecycle

Bullets follow a three-tier lifecycle: **active → archived → purged**.

- **Active** — Default state. Included in materialization, subject to forgetting curve.
- **Archived** — Low-salience or stale bullets moved to cold storage. Recoverable via restore.
- **Purged** — Permanently deleted after `purge_after_days`. Irrecoverable.

Capacity management with pressure levels:
- **Normal** (<80%) — Standard consolidation
- **High** (80-95%) — Aggressive consolidation (lower dedup threshold, higher archive salience)
- **Critical** (95-100%) — Very aggressive consolidation
- **Full** (100%) — New bullet additions blocked until space is freed

# Pass tools to your OpenAI agent, handle calls with:
result = await handler.handle_tool_call(function_name, arguments)
```

## Data Model

### Bullet (Atomic Knowledge Unit)

Each bullet is a single actionable insight with full usage and lifecycle tracking:

```
Bullet {
  id, section, content, bullet_type, source_type,
  hit_count, miss_count, recall_count,        # Usage tracking
  salience, confidence,                        # Lifecycle
  effective_salience = salience x (0.5 + hit_rate),  # Computed
  lifecycle_state,                             # active | archived | purged
  archive_reason,                              # Why it was archived
}
```

**Bullet types:** `fact`, `decision`, `strategy`, `warning`, `procedure`, `exception`, `principle`, `episodic` (timestamped events; merged with a looser similarity threshold and excluded from contradiction detection)

### SchemaNode (Abstract Pattern)

Derived from repeated experiences. Enables efficient context encoding:

```
SchemaNode {
  id, name, description,
  instance_count, confidence,
  bullet_ids                                   # Associated bullets
}
```

### DeltaOperation (Atomic Mutation)

Every graph change is tracked:

```
DeltaBatch {
  operations: [
    { op_type: ADD_BULLET | UPDATE_BULLET | REMOVE_BULLET | MERGE_BULLETS | ... }
  ],
  bullets_added, bullets_updated, bullets_removed, bullets_merged
}
```

## Acknowledgments & Research

Engram's architecture draws from four primary sources:

### Agentic Context Engineering (ACE)

The Reflector/Curator ingestion pipeline, bullet-point storage structure, delta update mechanism, and execution feedback integration are directly inspired by the ACE framework:

> **Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving Language Models**
> Qizheng Zhang, Changran Hu, Shubhangi Upasani, Boyuan Ma, Fenglu Hong, Vamsidhar Kamanuru, Jay Rainton, Chen Wu, Mengmeng Ji, Hanchen Li, Urmish Thakker, James Zou, Kunle Olukotun
> Stanford University, SambaNova Systems
> [arXiv:2510.04618](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618)

Key ACE insights incorporated into Engram:
- **Itemized bullet-point context** rather than free-form text, enabling granular updates
- **Delta operations (ADD/UPDATE/REMOVE)** instead of full context rewrites, preventing context collapse
- **Split Reflector/Curator pipeline** — separating analysis from storage decisions improves extraction quality
- **Execution feedback signals** — structured success/failure signals produce better reflections than parsing raw conversation text

### Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC)

The recall-time retrieval of nearest prior raw inputs as **worked examples**, the optional surfacing of per-bullet usage counters in the rendered prompt, and the explicit "verify before copying" caveat next to retrieved precedents come from Dynamic Cheatsheet:

Key DC insights incorporated into Engram:
- **Adjacent worked-example injection at recall** — top-k similar prior (input, output) pairs placed last in the rendered context (closest to the question) materially helps generators on code/math-style tasks (the `<worked_examples>` block in Engram)
- **Per-item usage counts surfaced in the prompt** — `(used N×, success Y/Z)` lets the consuming LLM weight proven items
- **Bounded recall blob with "verify, don't copy" framing** — retrieved precedents are semantically close, not necessarily correct

Engram deliberately does **not** adopt DC's wholesale-rewrite update policy or its LLM-incremented usage counters without outcome signal — both are weaknesses DC inherits from lacking structured storage. Engram's delta ops + reconsolidation tied to a real outcome strictly dominate that pattern.

### Mem-α: Learning Memory Construction via Reinforcement Learning

The **core-memory slot**, the **episodic / semantic memory distinction**, and the optional **content-validity gate** at write time come from Mem-α:

Key Mem-α insights incorporated into Engram:
- **Core Memory as an always-in-context slot** — Mem-α's strongest architectural lesson is that an explicit, bounded running summary survives compaction even when retrieval misses. Engram implements this as a ≤512-token blob per context, rewritten by the Reflector and prepended at every recall.
- **Episodic vs semantic memory split** — episodic bullets are timestamped events formatted `At {timestamp}, {actor} {did X}`, merged with a looser threshold (paraphrased event reports are common across agents), and exempted from contradiction detection (events don't contradict — both can be true at different timestamps).
- **Content-validity signal at write time** — Mem-α's γ-reward (an LLM-judge over each candidate write) was indispensable in their ablation. Engram exposes this as an opt-in `enable_validity_gate` in the Curator, batched into a single LLM call per commit.

Because Engram is a runtime/server (not a training framework), it does **not** implement Mem-α's RL training loop. The mechanisms above are the training-free distillation of what the learned policy converges to.

### Cognitive Neuroscience

The reconsolidation loop, schema formation, active forgetting (Ebbinghaus decay), consolidation ("sleep cycle"), and salience-based retrieval are inspired by established neuroscience research on human memory systems, including:

- **Memory reconsolidation** — recalled memories become malleable and are re-stored in modified form (Nader, Schiller & Phelps, 2010)
- **Schema theory** — abstract frameworks built from repeated experience that change how new experiences are encoded (Bartlett, 1932; Piaget; van Kesteren et al., 2012)
- **Forgetting curve** — memory strength decays exponentially without rehearsal, and spaced recall resets the decay (Ebbinghaus, 1885)
- **Consolidation** — background reorganization during sleep that abstracts patterns and strengthens important connections (Born & Wilhelm, 2012)
